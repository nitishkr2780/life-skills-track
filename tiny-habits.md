### **Question 2:** How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

**Answer:**
- **M (Motivation):** Ensure that the habit you want to establish aligns with your motivations and values. Make it something you genuinely want to do.
- **A (Ability):** Simplify the habit to the point where it's easy to perform. Break it down into smaller steps if necessary to increase your ability to do it.
- **P (Prompt):** Use prompts or cues to trigger the habit. Make the cue obvious and tied to a specific context to increase the likelihood of following through.

### **Question 3:** Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

**Answer:** Celebrating success after completing a habit reinforces positive behavior by associating it with a reward. This triggers the brain's reward system, making it more likely that the behavior will be repeated in the future. Celebrating small wins also boosts motivation and confidence, which are essential for habit formation.

### **Question 5:** What is the book's perspective about Identity?

**Answer:** The book emphasizes the role of identity in habit formation. It suggests that lasting change occurs when habits become part of one's identity. By shifting your identity to align with the habits you want to adopt, you're more likely to stick to them over time.

### **Question 6:** How does the book suggest making a habit easier to do?

**Answer:** The book suggests making habits easier to do by reducing friction and increasing convenience. This can involve breaking habits down into smaller steps, creating specific plans, and removing obstacles that hinder habit performance. By making habits simple and accessible, they become more likely to stick.

### **Question 7:** How does the book suggest making a habit harder to do?

**Answer:** The book recommends making undesirable habits harder to do by increasing friction and adding obstacles. This can involve creating barriers between yourself and the habit, such as removing temptations, changing your environment, or adding steps that make the habit less convenient. By making undesirable habits more difficult to engage in, you're less likely to fall into them.

# Listening and Active Communication

## Active Listening: Steps/Strategies

Active listening is a crucial communication skill that involves fully hearing and comprehending what someone is saying. Here are some steps/strategies to do active listening:

- **Focus on the speaker and topic:** Avoid getting distracted by your own thoughts or external factors such as music or noise. Give the speaker your undivided attention.
  
- **Do not interrupt the other person:** Let the speaker finish their thoughts before responding. Interrupting can lead to misunderstandings and frustration.
  
- **Use door openers:** Door openers are phrases that show you're interested and keep the other person talking. Examples include "tell me more about that," "I see," and "go on."
  
- **Listen with body language:** If appropriate, use body language to show you're listening. This can include nodding, maintaining eye contact, and facing the speaker directly.
  
- **Take notes during important conversations:** This can help you remember key points and show the speaker that you value their input.
  
- **Paraphrase what others have said:** This can help ensure you're both on the same page and prevent misunderstandings.

## Reflective Listening (Fisher's Model)

Reflective listening is a subset of active listening that involves mirroring body language, emotions, and verifying the message. It is used in critical situations such as conversations between air traffic controllers and pilots, military missions, and emotionally charged conversations in personal relationships.

### Key Points of Reflective Listening

According to Fisher's model, reflective listening involves the following key points:

- **Listen carefully to the speaker:** Pay attention to both the content and emotion of the message.
  
- **Mirror the speaker's body language:** This can help establish a connection and show empathy.
  
- **Paraphrase the message:** This can help ensure you've understood the message correctly and give the speaker an opportunity to correct any misunderstandings.

## Obstacles in Listening Process

Some common obstacles in the listening process include:

- **Distractions:** External factors such as noise or internal factors such as thoughts can distract from the message.
  
- **Preconceptions:** Preconceptions or assumptions about the speaker or topic can prevent full comprehension.
  
- **Judgment:** Judging the speaker or message before fully hearing it can lead to misunderstandings.

## Improving Listening Skills

To improve listening skills, consider the following:

- **Practice active listening:** Focus on the speaker, avoid distractions, and use door openers.
  
- **Minimize distractions:** Find a quiet place to talk or eliminate external distractions.
  
- **Suspend judgment:** Try to understand the speaker's perspective before forming an opinion.
  
- **Take notes:** Taking notes can help you remember key points and show the speaker that you value their input.
  
- **Paraphrase the message:** This can help ensure you've understood the message correctly and give the speaker an opportunity to correct any misunderstandings.

## Types of Communication

There are three main types of communication: passive, aggressive, and assertive.

- **Passive communication** involves not expressing thoughts or feelings and often leads to resentment.
  
- **Aggressive communication** involves expressing thoughts or feelings in a way that disregards the feelings of others and often leads to conflict.
  
- **Assertive communication** involves expressing thoughts or feelings in a way that respects both the speaker and the listener's feelings and needs.

## Switching Communication Styles

People may switch communication styles based on the situation or their relationship with the other person. Here are some examples:

- **Passive communication:** A person may switch to passive communication when they feel intimidated or unsure of themselves.
  
- **Aggressive communication:** A person may switch to aggressive communication when they feel angry or frustrated.
  
- **Passive-aggressive communication:** A person may switch to passive-aggressive communication when they want to express their anger or frustration without directly addressing it.

## Making Communication Assertive

To make communication assertive, consider the following:

- **Express thoughts and feelings clearly:** Use "I" statements to express your thoughts and feelings without blaming or criticizing the other person.
  
- **Respect the other person's feelings and needs:** Listen actively and show empathy towards the other person's perspective.
  
- **Find a solution:** Work together to find a solution that respects both the speaker and listener's needs.

## Conclusion

Good communication is essential, and active listening is a vital part of it. By focusing on the speaker, avoiding interruptions, and using body language to show engagement, we can understand each other better. Reflective listening adds depth by mirroring emotions and paraphrasing messages.
To improve listening skills, minimize distractions, avoid assumptions, and take notes. Understanding communication styles helps navigate conversations effectively. Assertive communication, where we express ourselves clearly while respecting others, fosters healthier relationships and better outcomes.
